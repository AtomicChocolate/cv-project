# CV Application Maker

[**Made as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

An interactive tool to create a CV application. Fill in the form, and a CV will automatically be generated and previewed as you edit.

This project was done to help me learn React and TypeScript, as I have done very little in neither before this project.

This website has responsive design, so for smaller screen sizes the website is still easy to read and interact with. The website will also change colors based on your device's dark mode setting.
